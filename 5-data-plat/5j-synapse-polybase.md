# Import data into Azure Synapse Analytics by using PolyBase

- Explore how PolyBase works
- Upload text data to Azure Blob storage
- Collect security keys for Blob storage
- Create a data warehouse
- Import data from Blob storage


The fastest and most scalable way to load data is through PolyBase, a technology that accesses external data stored in Azure Blob storage, Hadoop, or Azure Data Lake Store via T-SQL.

Follow these steps to implement a PolyBase extract, load, and transform process for Azure Synapse Analytics:
1. Extract the source data into text files.
2. Load the data into Azure Blob storage, Hadoop, or Azure Data Lake Store.
3. Import the data into Azure Synapse Analytics staging tables by using PolyBase.
4. Transform the data (optional).
5. Insert the data into production tables.
