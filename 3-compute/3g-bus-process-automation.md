- Azure Functions
- Power Automate
- Logic Apps
- WebJobs


Evaluation of services for integration and process automation.


## Common business problems

Business processes modeled in software are often called <b>workflows</b>. Azure includes four different technologies that can be used to build and implement workflows that can integrate multiple systems:

- Logic Apps
- Microsoft Power Automate
- WebJobs
- Azure Functions

Similarities are:

- They accept inputs, a piece of data or file that is supplied to a workflow.
- Run actions, a simple operation that the workdlow exectures and may modify data or cause another action to be performed.
- Include conditions, a test often run against an input that may decide which action to execute next.
- Produce outputs, a piece of data or a file that is created by the workflow.


## Design-first technologies

Analysts designing a business process often draw a flow diagram on paper. Logic Apps and Power Automate can take a similar aproach to designing a workflow. Both have user interfaces in which you can draw out the workflow.


### Logic Apps

For developers and IT pros. Advanced integration projects

### Microsoft Power Automate

For office workers and business analysts. Self-service workflow.

- Service that you can use to create workflows even when you have no development of IT Pro experience.

    - <b>Scheduled</b> flow that executes on a regular basis such as once a week, on a date, or at a time
    - <b>Business process</b> flow that models a business process can notify required people, approval flows , calendar dates for steps, record time of flow steps.
