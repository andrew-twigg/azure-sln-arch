# Expose multiple Azure Function apps as a consistent API by using Azure API Management

Combine multiple Azure Functions apps into a unified interface by importing them into a single Azure API Management instance.

APIM enables construction of an API from a set of disparate microservices. 

- Microservices distributed app architecture
- collection of microservices
- defined domain of responsibility
- developed, deployed, scaled independently
- easier to understand, improve, and test
- easier CD because only change small part of an app
- APIM implements the cross-cutting requirements such as caching and security
- APIM Consumption tier is especially suited to microservice-based architectures and event-driven systems
    - no infrastructure to manage
    - no idle capacity
    - high availability
    - automatic scaling
    - usage-based pricing


Microservices architectures can be hard to manage. Separate teams implementing cross-cutting requirements.
