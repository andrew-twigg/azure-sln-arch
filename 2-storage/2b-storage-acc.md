# Create an Azure Storage account

Azure Storage accounts help formalise types of policies such as storing data in a specific region and separate data category billing, and apply them to your data.

## What is Azure Storage?

An Azure resource that includes:

- Blobs
- Files
- Queues
- Tables

Can be managed as a group. 

Choose Resource Manager deployment model and StorageV2 because everything else is legacy.
